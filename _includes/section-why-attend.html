        <p>Yes, this goes on your resume.  In addition to celebrating women in engineering, this mini-conference is a rare opportunity for you to attend a full-scale engineering conference all in one day.  The outrageous part?  It’s completely free. </p>
        <p>WomEngineers Day will consist of keynote speakers, discussion panels, and breakout workshops to provide YOU with professional and personal life skills not covered in your engineering curriculum.  For those who are interested in the sticky sides of things, some of the breakout sessions will feature debates.  And the coolest part: everything you
        hear will be coming straight from the <em>presidents and vice presidents of engineering companies, UT alumni, and other high profile experts</em>.  Seriously, this is something you DO NOT want to miss.</p>
        <p>Explore the other tabs of this website for session and speaker details.  UT’s College of Engineering Board of Advisors, big time corporation representatives, UT engineering departments and student organizations, and news reporters will ALL be there.  Come grow as an engineer with us on April 11, 2015 at the Knoxville Convention Center.</p>
